## Codeforces-Round-993--Div4
There were eight problems, with one split into two subtasks, to be solved in 2 hours and 15 minutes. Participate or you'll have to wait another millennium for a Div. 4 round. The format of the event will be identical to Div. 3 rounds: ICPC rules with a penalty of 10 minutes for an incorrect submission; 12-hour phase of open hacks after the end of the round (hacks do not give additional points) after the end of the open hacking phase, all solutions will be tested on the update
d set of tests, and the ratings recalculated 
by default.

I solved four problems out of 8. Let me know if you have any questions or want to discuss this type of problem.
